      <h1 style="text-align: center; background-color: black; color: white;">Project Proposal: Degree Verification</h1>
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
          <p>Here in university, after passing out most of the students start looking for jobs or internships. They get so busy in their job that they don’t even find little time in working days
          for their important work. As we know that students are awarded transcript as their record of university grades and performance, and degree is issued after at least 6 months so students have to visit again several times to degree section in our university and many students live in far cities and many go abroad for higher studies so it’s quite difficult for them to visit university not once but many times.
           
          So we have proposed a solution to this problem for the welfare of students and degree section staff to shift this process to a digital way. The project is designed to help students request their allocation of degree and administration to verify their request and generate fee receipt of issuance of degree and then calling student or someone on behalf of the student to collect degree from degree section.</p>
          <h3>1.2	 Objective:</h3>
          
                 <pre> Following are the objectives of this project
          •	Students request for allocation of degree
          •	Student may check the present status of their request and pay degree allocation fee online. 
          •	Students may pay fee of degree allocation by generating pdf by admin after verification.
          •	Admin may accept or decline request if not meeting the requesting criteria.
          •	Admin will check for the requirements that student have followed to complete the degree.
          •	Admin side will generate fee receipt of the degree allocation to be paid by student.
          •	Admin side will inform student about the successful or unsuccessful request.</pre>
          
         <h3> 1.3 Project Scope:</h3>
          
          There are many universities that are using this type of portal to manage this department via online processing and requesting. This project will build a web app and mobile app for users to use whatever they like. It will be an efficient and user friendly project for making things easier for both students and administration. 
          
          <h3>1.4 Proposed Solution:</h3>
          
          IIUIDEGREEPORTAL.com is an efficient website and mobile application for requesting and checking status for allocation of degree. In this online service, student can simply request allocation of degree by entering his registration number and fathers name and some important and basic info. Student will receive message if his/her record is successfully find in database of portal and will provided with a unique case number to check present status of request.
          Admin will check that whether the request is according to rules for example to check whether the allocation of degree is requested at least after 6 months of completion of degree. Then he will check that whether the student has passed the minimum number of credit hours, core courses, no more than one D grade in overall degree and not in any core courses, maintained at least more than 2.0 CGPA. Then he will generate PDF of fee receipt of degree allocation and send in status page for student to submit the photo of submitted receipt and then verifying that receipt and telling to collect his/her degree from degree office.
